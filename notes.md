Primary Key: A unique index that signifies the identitfing column. Should be unique for each row. 


Foreign Key: A type of index we use that points to the primary of a row of a different table. It points to that value by having the same value as a primary key in a different table. Essentially it creates these links between multiple tables. If the foreign key is pointing to a primary key in a different table, they have to be the same data type.

ex. if the primary key in table 1 is and interger then the foriegn key in table 2 has to be an integer. They have to match.
